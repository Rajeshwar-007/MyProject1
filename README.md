### Business Problem

In recent years, City Hotel and Resort Hotel have seen high cancellation rates. Each
hotel is now dealing with a number of issues as a result, including fewer revenues and
less than ideal hotel room use. Consequently, lowering cancellation rates is both hotelsâ€™
primary goal in order to increase their efficiency in generating revenue, and for us to
offer thorough business advice to address this problem.
The analysis of hotel booking cancellations as well as other factors that have no bearing
on their business and yearly revenue generation are the main topics of this report.


### Research Question

1. What are the variables that affect hotel reservation cancellations?

2. How can we make hotel reservations cancellations better?

3. How will hotels be assisted in making pricing and promotional decisions?


### Suggestions

1. Cancellation rates rise as the price does. In order to prevent cancellations of
reservations, hotels could work on their pricing strategies and try to lower the
rates for specific hotels based on locations. They can also provide some
discounts to the consumers.

2. As the ratio of the cancellation and not cancellation of the resort hotel is higher in
the resort hotel than the city hotels. So the hotels should provide a reasonable
discount on the room prices on weekends or on holidays.

3. In the month of January, hotels can start campaigns or marketing with a
reasonable amount to increase their revenue as the cancellation is the highest in
this month.

4. They can also increase the quality of their hotels and their services mainly in
Portugal to reduce the cancellation rate.
